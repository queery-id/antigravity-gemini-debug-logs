# Antigravity Gemini 3 Debugging Logs

This repository contains comprehensive documentation and logs from a systematic debugging session regarding Gemini 3 model failures in the Antigravity IDE.

## 🔍 Overview
Gemini 3 models (Flash and Pro) were experiencing "Agent execution terminated due to error" in Workspace mode, while working perfectly in Playground mode.

##  Key Discoveries
1. **Path Sensitivity:** Gemini 3 models on Windows fail to execute tools if the workspace path contains spaces.
2. **MCP Conflict:** The Microsoft Power BI Modeling MCP server triggers a specific crash in Gemini 3 models, even on clean paths.

## �� Documentation
- \Antigravity_Bug_Report_Gemini3_Tool_Execution.md\: The main bug report and investigation timeline.
- \Workspace_Path_Migration_Analysis.md\: Analysis of how renaming workspace folders impacts configuration.
- \MCP_Binary_Search_Testing_Guide.md\: Methodology used to isolate the problematic MCP server.
- \PBI_GitHub_Correlation.md\: Correlation of local findings with official Microsoft GitHub issues.

##  Resolution
Stability was restored by:
1. Renaming the workspace path to remove spaces.
2. Disabling the PBI MCP server while using Gemini 3 models.
